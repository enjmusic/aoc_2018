# Advent of Code 2018

My attempts at the problems specified for the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) event, implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Each day of the month (`n = 1-25`) is implemented in its own standalone Cargo project in a subdirectory named `aoc_<n>`.
